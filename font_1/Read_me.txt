ALGERIAN CONCRETE FONT, AND THE IDEA BEHIND IT.
----------------------------------------------

For so long i wanted to make my own font, As i was always fascinated 
by the simple geometry architecture especially the Brutalist buildings, 
So i sat down, turn on my PC, opened Illustrator, blocked some basic shapes 
that kinda looks like a cool font, And here is the result. 
You can use this font in any type of projectpersonal or commercial.
A credit back to my prtfolio would be appreciated.
